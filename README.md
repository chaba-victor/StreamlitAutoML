## Automated machine learning (AutoML)

Automated machine learning, often known as AutoML, is the practice of employing ML models to solve practical issues. It automates the selection, composition, and parameterization of machine learning models, to be more precise. Automating the machine learning process makes it more user-friendly and often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms. Machine learning is now more accessible to enterprises without dedicated data scientists or machine learning specialists,Â thanks to AutoML software platforms. These platforms can be bought from an outside provider, accessed through open source repositories like GitHub, or developed in-house.

### How AutoML process works

AutoML is normaly a platform that simplifies the steps involed in a machine learning process; handling a raw dataset to deploying a practical machine learning model. In traditional ML, models are hard coded, and each step in the process handled separately.
